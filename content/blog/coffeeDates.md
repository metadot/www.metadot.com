# HOW VIRTUAL COFFEE DATES IMPACTED OUR ORGANIZATION

As we entered another lock-down cycle amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, we knew that 
this was going to create challenges for everyone. Remote work certainly has its 
positives, but we knew that the lack of social interaction, and the ability to draw
the line between work and home life - would become increasingly more difficult. 
Burnout is a very real, and very prominent issue that we aim to avoid at all costs. 
I had a discussion with our founder & CEO Daniel, where we shared concerns and brainstormed 
ideas of how to make this time less difficult. We saw it as an opportunity not just to relieve
the team of some stress, but instill habits of growth that will be beneficial long after the 
quarantine period. Thus, the Metadot “Coffee Dates” were born.
