# MEETINGS - A FOUR STEP PROCESS TO ALLEVIATE THE STRESS OF REMOTE MEETINGS 

We have all been there. The work day meetings that seem to last hours, and content that leaves you more confused than when you started. It is common for employees to have these feelings towards meetings, and they uphold this reputation in a variety of workplaces. Based on a study from The Business Journals, employees reported that 63% of meetings were not useful, and could have been handled through an email.  Metadot has created a 4 step process that combats these characteristics and allows employers to evaluate their meeting structure and improve this system. This means eliminating over half the scheduled meetings on average - increasing productivity time for your team significantly. As well as strategic methods to condense meeting time, without condensing the quality of the material. Follow these four easy steps to recreate the structure of your organization, and create a happier work environment for all. 

## Step 1 - Content of the Meeting
This is simple. Reflect on the topics you want to cover in the meeting, and make sure you properly prepare notes on how to communicate these topics. If a topic is difficult or controversial, consult with your HR team while preparing your presentation. Once you have established this information, create a meeting agenda and send this documentation three days in advance so participants have time to review the information and understand what to expect. When you are in a remote environment, it is best to avoid what is known as a “hybrid” meeting structure. A hybrid meeting is when a portion of your team is in a collocated environment, and the remainder of your team is working remotely. This makes communication challenging because one webcam is being used for multiple people. Not only do they face technical difficulties with unclear audio, but also difficulties in communication when the two groups talk over one another. The remote workers often receive less opportunity to share ideas and have access to the collaborative environment that those in the physical workplace will have.  To avoid this, it is suggested to hold meetings where the entire team is remote, or the entire team is physically together. These meetings should be interesting, and concise. For remote meetings, your information should be presented through a shared screen, with clear topics and information. The slides of the presentation should be interesting, but not distracting. The leader of the meeting should reference the slide, while giving a deeper elaboration on the content. Assign an assistant or willing member of the team to take notes and upload these notes to a community page after the meeting, along with the presentation slides. Your employees will feel less stress about receiving the content, and this will create a healthier environment to receive information.
