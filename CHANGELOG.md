# Changelog

All notable changes to www.metadot.com will be documented in this file.

## [2.1.3.1] - 2026-06-12

### Changed
- `/apps-overview` — tightened the CTA-box copy: dropped "current" and "Helpdesk" so it reads "your Mojo subscription", and split "Book a quick session..." onto its own line.

## [2.1.3.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- `/apps-overview` — Metadot Apps overview landing page for the apps win-back email campaign. Frames the Wistia tour video (`qk060qfgke`) in a rounded, dark-themed player and drives a single CTA that opens an embedded onboarding-booking calendar in a modal (Escape/backdrop-dismiss, scroll-lock, `role="dialog"`).
- `src/app/apps-overview/BookingCta.tsx` — client component for the CTA button + booking modal.

### Changed
- `next-sitemap.config.js` — exclude `/apps-overview` from the sitemap and add a `robots.txt` disallow. The page also carries a `noindex, nofollow` robots meta tag, so it is reachable by emailed recipients but kept out of search results.

## [2.1.2.1] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- `/privacy-policy` — "Google User Data" section covering Google API Services data: scopes accessed (account email, calendar list, free/busy, app-created events, Meet info), usage limited to scheduling/calendar features, no-sale/sharing terms, TLS + encrypted-token storage, and retention/deletion on disconnect or `support@metadot.com` request. Satisfies Google OAuth verification disclosure requirements.

## [2.1.2.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- `/privacy-policy` — Metadot Corporation privacy policy and GDPR statement
- `/terms-of-service` — Terms governing use of Metadot products
- `/hipaa` — HIPAA posture, BAA availability, and FAQ
- `/soc2` — SOC 2 Type II program overview with six-pillar security grid
- `/accessibility` — WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance statement, VPAT request path
- Footer "Compliance" column linking the five new pages
- `src/components/legal/LegalPage.tsx` — shared layout for compliance pages
- `.legal-content` typography rules in `globals.css`

### Changed
- Footer grid widened to 5 columns at `lg`, 2 at `md`, 1 at mobile
- `conductor.json` run script now passes `--port $CONDUCTOR_PORT` so multiple workspaces can run dev servers in parallel; added `runScriptMode: "concurrent"`
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` approves build scripts for `sharp` and `unrs-resolver` (resolves pnpm 11 `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` that blocked the Conductor Run button)

## [2.1.1.11] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- `/apps-mockup` stray `/* Constellation network… */` comment no longer leaks as visible text above the orbit (was unwrapped JSX-adjacent text instead of a `{/* */}` block)
- `/apps-mockup` Safari: hero benefit pills no longer leak the colored bubble outside the rounded edge — added `clip-path: inset(0 round 9999px)` to force clipping that Safari skips for `overflow:hidden` + `rounded-full` + `backdrop-blur`

### Changed
- `/apps-mockup` Stackr project icon swapped from `LayoutList` to `Kanban` (lucide-react)

## [2.1.1.10] - 2026-05-06

### Changed
- `/apps-mockup` connection animation rebuilt as a constellation network: every app sits statically on the ellipse and is permanently wired to the central workspace via slate L- or Z-shaped paths (every line has at least one 90° turn — no straight spokes); 2–3 colored dots per wire travel through with linear easing, mixed inbound/outbound, glowing drop-shadow
- `/apps-mockup` connection animation no longer pauses on hover or modal — the network keeps animating regardless of interaction state

### Removed
- `/apps-mockup` orbiting `orbitLoop` rotation and the previous comet-tail trail rendering

## [2.1.1.9] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- `/apps-mockup` Safari: app icons no longer shift to the start on hover — scale transform applied directly to the SVG instead of an `inline-flex` wrapper that Safari mis-centered inside the grid cell

### Changed
- `/apps-mockup` app modal: replaced the bottom prev/next/"x of x apps" footer and standalone close button with a single top-right button group (← / → / ✕)
- `/apps-mockup` "Stackr" renamed to "Stackr project"

## [2.1.1.8] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- `/apps-mockup` app set: orbit now shows the production app lineup — Assets, BookMe, Changelogs, CRM, Inventory, Knowledge base, Polls, Stackr, Suppliers, Tickets, Workflows (11 apps, was 10)
- `/apps-mockup` icons: every app tile now uses a `lucide-react` icon (Monitor, CalendarCheck, FileText, Handshake, Package, BookOpen, BarChart3, LayoutList, Truck, Ticket, Zap) instead of an emoji; same icon also renders inside the modal header so the orbit and detail view stay visually consistent
- `/apps-mockup` color palette refreshed to match the new icon set (rose CRM, emerald BookMe/Suppliers, amber Tickets, etc.)

### Added
- `lucide-react` dependency for icon components

## [2.1.1.7] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- `/apps-mockup` orbit (mobile): tight 120px circle replaces the wide 656×406 ellipse so all 10 apps now fit on a phone instead of being clipped by `overflow-hidden`; center logo becomes a clean circle on mobile and stays an oval on desktop
- `/apps-mockup` orbit: removed the three concentric dashed rings on every breakpoint for a cleaner stage
- `/apps-mockup` orbit (mobile): added a "now showing" pill at the bottom that cycles through apps every 5s and opens that app's modal when tapped
- `/apps-mockup` rotation slowed from 60s to 90s per revolution

### Added
- `/apps-mockup` connection streaks: small color-coded line segments flow between each app and the central workspace, communicating that the apps "talk to" the workspace; each app's streak does both directions per cycle (out then in, with idle gaps), randomized per app for an organic feel; about two streaks visible at any moment
- `/apps-mockup` workspace pulse: two staggered radial-gradient rings breathe outward from the center "m" logo, anchoring it as the active hub

## [2.1.1.6] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- `/apps-mockup` orbit: new "Projects" app tile (violet, 🗂️) with planning, kanban, timeline, and reporting bullets — brings the orbit to 10 apps

### Changed
- `/apps-mockup` hero: removed the "Connected Workspace." subline so the headline ends on "Metadot Apps"; the "Everything you need to run your business…" tagline now stays on a single line on `sm:` and up
- `/apps-mockup` benefit pills: each badge now has a soft colored bubble glow plus a colored dot (blue / pink / amber) for visual rhythm
- `/apps-mockup` orbit hover: app tiles now show a pointer cursor, get a soft white halo, brighten 10%, and the emoji scales up 25% for clearer affordance
- `/apps-mockup` modal: CTA changed from "Join private beta →" to "Discover it in private beta" (no arrow); fixed the "X of Y apps" counter so it vertically centers with the prev/next arrow buttons
- `/apps-mockup` CTA copy: header and bottom buttons now read "Join the private beta"; all `/beta` link buttons force white text to override the inherited link color

## [2.1.1.5] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- `/apps-mockup` orbit: hovering an app tile now reveals its name and pauses the animation automatically; the manual pause button has been removed
- `/apps-mockup` modal: cleaned up copy ("Selected app" label removed, "Learn More" → "Join private beta" linked to `/beta`) and replaced the "Next App" button with compact previous/next arrows around the page indicator
- `/apps-mockup` CTA banner: header and bottom CTA now read "Join private beta"; removed the secondary "See How It Works" button

## [2.1.1.4] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- New noindex mockup route at `/apps-mockup` for the Metadot Apps Connected Workspace concept (link-only, kept under the regular site header/footer)
- Orbiting app tiles around the central "m" logo: 9 apps trace an animated elliptical path drawn with `@property` + CSS `cos()`/`sin()`, with pause/resume control that freezes both the apps and the dashed ring
- Click any app tile to open a modal with its description, feature bullets, and "Learn More" / "Next App" actions; closes via ✕, backdrop click, or Escape
- Floating CTA header that emerges as you scroll, with a "Join the Private Beta" button on the right
- Sitemap and robots.txt now exclude `/apps-mockup` and `/preview-mockup` so neither route gets indexed

## [2.1.1.3] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- Beta page: "How many tools is your team running?" cost-band section with tool chips (Project mgmt, Scheduling, CRM, Automation, Change tracking)
- Beta page: "Put your work on autopilot." workflows section with 3 automation cards (CRM→Stackr, BookMe→CRM, Stackr→Changelog)
- Beta page: "AI that does the work, not just answers questions." section with 4 examples

### Changed
- Beta page hero: simplified subcopy to "Project management, CRM, scheduling, tickets, and more." with new "Connected apps. Powered by AI." tagline

### Removed
- Beta page: "Built by the team behind Mojo Helpdesk" line and the "Why it exists" pain-points section

## [2.1.1.2] - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- Beta page hero: updated heading to "Productivity apps for teams." with new tagline and description
- Beta page "Why it exists" section: updated heading to "Built for teams that want to move faster."
- Stackr Projects and Changelog app descriptions refreshed with clearer product positioning
- Beta page metadata (description, OpenGraph) updated to match new copy
- Removed "Beta" link from header navigation (desktop and mobile)

## [2.1.1.1] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- Text contrast sitewide: replaced `#475569` (slate-600, ~3.3:1 ratio) with `#94a3b8` (slate-400, ~6.7:1) on all section labels, footer copyright, blog page labels, beta page labels, BlogCard quote text, and product tag badge text and border
- Blog post reading well: replaced white background (`#fff`) with dark card (`#1e293b`) — consistent with the site's existing card pattern, eliminates jarring light-on-dark contrast transition
- Product tag badge border updated for visibility (1.93:1 → 5.71:1 contrast)
- `tsconfig.json` jsx mode set to `preserve` (required by Next.js 16 SWC transform)

## [2.1.1.0] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- Redesigned `/beta` page to match updated mockup: SVG icons with pastel backgrounds, color-matched badges per app, increased border radius on cards, consistent section label styling, and "Metadot Apps" eyebrow above hero
